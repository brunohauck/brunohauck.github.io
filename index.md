## Welcome to Bruno Hauck Resume

Working in the development area for over 10 years, I had my first contact with a computer at 13 years old and was passionate at first sight and I even came up with a 14 year old Javascript HTML site in 1995. She worked at the Government of Minas, education, health and Civil Police companies. Has extensive experience developing Mobile solutions on Android Java, Android Kotlin, React Native, IONIC and Flutter. Over 6 years of experience as a Mobile Technologies Teacher mainly Android Java and Android Koltin. Besides the vast experience with mobile has a fullstack profile in PHP, Angular, React.js, Javascript, Java, CSS, HTML, SQL. Also has extensive knowledge on Amazon servers, Devops tools like Docker, Jenkins and Heroku. Working remotely, for the past 3 months he has worked at Bairesdev as a Fullstack developer. In parallel in his spare time, he worked as a freelance and startup partner on Android technologies Kotlin, PHP Developer, IONIC, Angular, Node.js and React.js. Previously, she worked as a team to develop a Facial Recognition application for the Civil Police of the Government of Minas Gerais.

He is a specialist in Mobile Systems, Web and Networks and a Computer Science graduate, a postgraduate degree in Computer Networking and currently completing a Master's degree in Software Engineering.

Four months ago I started working remotely and I really enjoyed this working model. Today is my favorite.
Today I am dedicating only the completion of my masters and project I was working finished. What motivates me and I am pleased is to teach and teach programming mainly to non-technology students.
I was born and raised in Belo Horizonte. I already did Work and Travel exchange for the United States in 2004 and 2005 and worked at Harrah's and Ceaser casinos.

In all the companies where I worked, I always tried to do my best and work with innovative technologies. In my free time I always try to study new technologies like Machine Learning. What always motivates me is to see the final product in production and working properly and I'm very proud to have developed a face recognition artificial intelligence application for Civil Police of Minas Gerais and also participated in the development of MG App with over 200 thousand Downloads Nowadays I consider that I know very well all Mobile development technologies and also what is the best technology for a given project or work.
